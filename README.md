# 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting crop yield based on various environmental and agricultural factors. The dataset originates from World Bank data, published on Kaggle. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and apply Machine Learning (ML) models, including:

Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)
# 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information on crop yield across different regions, along with relevant features affecting productivity.

# Key Features:
Area – Geographic region
Climate Factors – Temperature, precipitation, etc.
Soil Properties – Fertility, moisture, etc.
Farming Inputs – Fertilizers, irrigation, etc.
Crop Yield (Target Variable) – Measured in hg/ha (hectograms per hectare)
⚙️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data Manipulation
Seaborn, Matplotlib – Data Visualization
Scikit-learn – ML Model Training
LightGBM – Gradient Boosting
